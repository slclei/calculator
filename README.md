Calculator from Shiyanlou

4/31 Finish entile code input. Several issues were found during input process:
1 when implenments actionListener, @Override actionPerformed should be automatically input. Otherwise there will be erros.
2 whole code is not perfact as OOP. 
3 severl field and method could be private.

TODO:
1 float actionListener seems has repeated code with number actionListener. Is there any way to simplify it?
2 Is there any way to seperate Calculator and cal()?
3 Is it possible to merge calListener into signalListener?

4/31 update:
Remove duplicate code in signalListener;
